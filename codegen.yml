      # There is a conflict with backend types. It generates a VehicleType as a type
      # and also an enum called VehicleType, there can't be two types with the same
      # name, so we have to resort to prefixing types and not doing so on enums
      # therefore we solve the problem. The perfect solution would be to have it solve
      # on the backend or prefix the enums and not the types, however I could not achieve
      # the latter so I ask backend team to look into this issue. If it's solved
